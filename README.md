## Abstract
Suppressing plasmid transfer in microbial communities has profound implications due to the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in spreading and maintaining diverse functional traits such as metabolic functions, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance. However, existing tools for inhibiting HGT are limited in their modes of delivery, efficacy, and scalability. Here, we present a versatile denial-of-spread (DoS) strategy to target and eliminate specific conjugative plasmids. Our strategy exploits retrotransfer, whereby an engineered DoS plasmid is introduced into host cells containing a target plasmid via the targetâ€™s own conjugative machinery. Acting as predatory gene drive, DoS propagates itself at the expense of the target plasmid, through competition or active elimination. Once the target plasmid is eradicated, DoS is removed via induced plasmid suicide, resulting in a community containing neither plasmid. The strategy is tunable and scalable for various conjugative plasmids, different mechanisms of plasmid inheritance interruption, or diverse environmental contexts. DoS represents a new tool for precision control of gene persistence in microbial communities.
